## CSS Additions
I added CSS to accomodate the error.pug page a bit better.
I changed back-ground colors of the buttons and side bar on the left.
I changed the font of the back buttons and made the bar were they are in smaller
Also I was playing around on the about page with the sentence in the middle so alterted some marings/paddings
and added a transition on the same sentence.
